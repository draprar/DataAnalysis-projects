# Data Analysis Projects 

This repository contains a collection of data analysis projects utilizing **Power BI, Excel, and Python (Jupyter Notebook)**. Each project demonstrates different aspects of **data visualization, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling**, showcasing how various tools can transform raw data into actionable insights.  

## Projects

### **Project 1: Dataline Bike Company Sales and Profit Analysis**  
- **Tools Used**: Power BI  
- **Data Source**: Sales data (2017-2020) from CSV and Excel files, covering orders, pricing, product costs, and sales territories.  
- **Key Insights**:  
  - Profitability by country (map visualization).  
  - Revenue and profit trends (line charts).  
  - Profit breakdown by category/subcategory (matrix with conditional formatting).  
  - Top 10 customers by revenue (bar charts).  
  - Interactive filtering for detailed order breakdown.  
- **Purpose**: This project replaces static reports with an interactive Power BI dashboard, helping Dataline Bike Company analyze product performance, revenue growth, and customer trends.  

### **Project 2: U.S. Electricity Prices Analysis by State and Sector**  
- **Tools Used**: Power BI  
- **Data Source**: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data on electricity prices (residential, commercial, industrial, transportation sectors) from 2002 onward.  
- **Key Insights**:  
  - Electricity price trends by state and provider.  
  - Forecasting future price trends (line charts).  
  - Drillthrough-enabled state-level analysis.  
  - KPI indicators highlighting states with highest/lowest electricity prices.  
- **Purpose**: This analysis provides insights into **regional electricity price trends**, supporting **energy policy evaluation, cost optimization, and market research**.  

### **Project 3: Gun Price Analysis and Prediction**  
- **Tools Used**: Power BI, Excel, Python (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **Data Source**: Firearm price dataset (Kaggle) with attributes like Age, Weight, Muzzle Velocity, Max Range, and Price.  
- **Key Insights**:  
  - **Power BI Analysis**:  
    - Overview: Key metrics (Total Revenue, Average Price) with interactive slicers.  
    - Price Analysis: Trends by age/weight (line/bar charts), category distribution (donut chart).  
    - Performance Metrics: Muzzle Velocity vs. Max Range (scatter plot), price-performance trends (ribbon chart), performance metric gauges.  
  - **Excel Analysis**:  
    - Data preprocessing, calculated fields, pivot tables, and interactive dashboards.  
    - Price distribution, category-based trends, and correlation insights.  
  - **Python (Jupyter Notebook) Analysis**:  
    - **Statistical Analysis**: Descriptive stats, distribution analysis.  
    - **Visualizations**:  
      - Box plots (price distribution by age/weight category).  
      - Relationship charts (scatter plots, heatmaps, pairplots).  
    - **Regression Modeling**:  
      - Price prediction using machine learning models.  
      - Model evaluation (RÂ², RMSE) and feature importance analysis.  
- **Purpose**: This project explores **factors influencing firearm prices**, leveraging **Power BI for visualization**, **Excel for structured data exploration**, and **Python for in-depth statistical analysis and predictive modeling**.
